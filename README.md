### Notes
I would be very happy and excited for you to try it out! But please note, if you want to use or test Katnip, there is
usually no point in cloning this repository or manually adding it as an NPM dependency. 
It is open source, so you are free to clone it and do whatever you want with it, of course.
But if you do that as the first thing you do, I would expect you to get a bit confused and not really knowing 
where to start. You probably don't even need to clone this repository even if you want to develop a plugin for Katnip. 
Cloning the repository is only useful if you plan to actually contribute to the core Katnip code base. Contributions to 
the code base are much welcome! But please try using it to create a website first, so you get a feel for the basic concepts.
